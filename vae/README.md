# VAE

This is my first attempt at working with the sheep and with pytorch, so this project
is somewhat of a proof of concept.


## Data

I used rendered frames from this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jlhqNxRYk) sampled
at 3 fps.

## Ideas

1. Train a VAE of static images of the sheep.
2. Trace paths in the latent space to create "sheep animations."
